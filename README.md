# Budget Tracker

## Description
This project required converting an existing budget tracking app into a Progressive Web App with offline persistence. Users may download the app to their smart device due to the use of a web manifest. Service Workers were installed to provide offline persistence, while IndexedDb was implemented in order to track transactions made by the user when they are without a data connection.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- IndexedDb
- Web Manifest
- Service Workers API

## Website Link
This app is deployed via Heroku:
